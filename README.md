my little C++ SDL2 particle explosion program

This little project walked me through the following programming concepts:
Used the SDL library for support in pixel operations, events and threading
Worked with an own namespace, defined in the header(.h) files
Used classes for the screen instance, the swarm and each individual particle for defining each individual's properties; for example in the particle's case its own speed and direction; for the screen: resolution, renderer, buffer
Applied a blur effect on the screen
Worked with rgb and trigonometric functions for cycling particles' colours
